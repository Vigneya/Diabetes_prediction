# Diabetes_prediction
Overview
This project is aimed at predicting whether a person has diabetes based on medical data such as glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, etc. It leverages machine learning models to provide an accurate prediction, which could be used as an assistive tool for healthcare professionals.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to classify whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using machine learning techniques. This prediction is based on features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, glucose, etc.

The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a popular dataset for this task.


Here is a sample README.md file for a machine learning project on diabetes prediction:
